# Data-Classifier-using-Decision-Tree-ML
This is a simple machine learning model built using a Decision Tree Classifier to classify fruits based on their size and color shade. The model uses basic features—fruit size in cm and color shade (from 1 to 10)—to predict whether the fruit is more likely to be an apple or an orange.
